# Information Theory with Python

An interactive online book for learning information theory concepts with Python implementations. This project provides hands-on experience with fundamental concepts like Entropy, Mutual Information, and Channel Capacity through interactive examples and visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Experiment with information theory concepts in real-time
- **Python Implementation**: Practical code examples for every concept
- **Downloadable Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for each chapter
- **No Login Required**: Open access educational content
- **Visual Understanding**: Interactive plots and visualizations

## Chapters
